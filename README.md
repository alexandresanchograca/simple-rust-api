# simple-rust-api
Simple REST API implementation with minimal dependencies using the Rust programming language.
It only uses serde for serialization and even that can be mitigated. I made it in a day to practice Rust and feel out the language. I could use any web rust framework to do this better and more robust, but the point was to practice and learn.
